# GUI_Smite_randomizer


How to use:

- put your own json file in the same folder as the program
- name your json file gods.json
- use the same format as the one I use as an example

What does it do:

- on the dropdown menu you can choose the class you want to play with
- after you press the "Random God" button the program will display a random god from that class and a random skin for that god

- in the entry box you can type the name or the nickname of the god
- after you press the "Random skin" button the program will display the god with a random skin
